\section{Conclusion}

While some speakers may benefit ever so slightly from the proposed ClusterModel, the overall performance of the model is slightly worse than the base wav2vec 2.0 model.
It is likely that large models like wav2vec 2.0 have the capacity to learn speaker-specific features, and that the proposed clustering approach is not necessary.
