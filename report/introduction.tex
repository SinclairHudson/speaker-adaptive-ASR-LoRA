\subsection{Motivation}

As shown in figure \ref{fig:by_speaker}, word error rate varies by speaker, with some speakers having double the error rate when compared to others.

      \caption{
          Word Error Rate (WER) by speaker on LibriSpeech test-clean. 
          Points are individual speakers, and the red line is the WER computed over the whole test-clean split.
          Variance in WER increases as the number of utterances per speaker decreases.

In this paper, we ask two research questions:
1. Can we improve the performance of an ASR system by incorporating speaker identity information?
2. Can an ASR system learn an explicit prior to improve performance on under-represented speakers?
