\subsection{Motivation}

As shown in figure \ref{fig:by_speaker}, word error rate varies by speaker, with some speakers having double the error rate when compared to others.

\subsection{Speaker Disentanglement}

The primary concern of speaker disentanglement is losing information relating to content.
Instead of removing speaker information, this work explicitly models different speakers and adapts the model to the speaker.
