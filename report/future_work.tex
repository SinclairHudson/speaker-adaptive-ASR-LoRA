\section{Threats to Validity and Future Work}

These results are quite preliminary, and there are many avenues for future work.
% Threats to validity
These results are based on a single dataset, LibriSpeech, and a single base model, wav2vec 2.0.
Extensive hyperparameter searches were not performed, which could provide improved performance.


% Future work
While the proposed AttentionLoRA model does not show good performance, similar ideas such as Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have shown great promise in language modelling tasks \cite{shazeer2017outrageously}.
Mixtor of Experts could be adapted to the ASR task.
